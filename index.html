        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Jason! I'm a nerdly type of person that is very passionate about education, cyber security, and video games. I love learning and teaching whatever it is that I can teach somebody. Sharing information is the way we become better as a society. People need to keep themselves safe in whatever way they can in today's cyber landscape. I enjoy learning about what it is that I can do to help people stay informed on how to go about this. Also, I enjoy learning about the newer concepts in video game creation. Eventually all learning will be done through gamification, and it is going to be amazing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I just recently completed my Master‚Äôs in Business Administration with a focus on Information Technology at Western Governors University. With a Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science and a Master‚Äôs in Cyber Security already under my belt, I have a solid mix of academic knowledge and real-world experience. I‚Äôve earned 12 AWS certifications and have hands-on experience with a wide range of programming languages and operating systems. I‚Äôm all about using this blend of skills to drive innovation and achieve great results in the tech world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my career at Amazon, I‚Äôve taken on various roles that have sharpened my skills in DevOps, cloud support, and team management. As a DevOps Support Engineer III, I‚Äôve led system improvements and mentored new engineers, making sure our software development processes run smoothly. My time as a Cloud Support Engineer saw me providing vital technical support to enterprise customers, ensuring their data was secure and their systems were robust. These roles have not only enhanced my technical know-how but also my ability to lead and communicate effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking to the future, I‚Äôm excited to explore new challenges and apply my skills in different settings. I‚Äôm aiming for roles where I can use my deep tech and business understanding to innovate and tackle complex problems. I‚Äôm committed to continuous learning and professional growth, staying on top of tech trends, and making meaningful contributions to any team I join. My dedication to excellence and proactive approach to career development will be key as I move forward and make an impact in the industry.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <p>
          This one!üòÜ This a project that should've taken 15 minutes to do but instead took me most of a Saturday due to me tweaking things and customizing it. The walkthrough for the project can be found here at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7AOvWpIVHU">Build a Mindblowing 3D Portfolio Website</a> by Fireship.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also a different version of this resume that can be found <a href="https://735783d.github.io/2d-portfolio-kaboom/">here</a> that shows it as a 2D video game style that is interactive. It is also from a tutorial that can be found here at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy_fSStEgMs&pp=ygUZZnJlZWNvZGVjYW1wIDJkIHBvcnRmb2xpbw%3D%3D">Build a Dev Portfolio as a 2D Game ‚Äì JavaScript Course</a>. I also customized it by editing the sprite map to make the play area larger to encompass all that was necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also dabble in 3D animation using Blender and Daz3d. I made the little animated short that can be found here at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EnahxXbyl4">ClaireandWraith v2</a>. I followed another tutorial that I found on YouTube to get this done that can be found here at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mISW4jLc4aE&list=PLVfwV2MU100IlsNvKPYcN4Q7Oo8GAuZLQ&index=67&t=0s">Create a pro car animation in Blender in just 15 minutes! Complete tutorial start to finish</a>. This one actually took a whole weekend to do with how much I ran off the rails with the customization. Things like video editing and sound design were not covered in the tutorial but I discovered little things to make it work for my first try.
